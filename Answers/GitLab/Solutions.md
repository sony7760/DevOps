### 1. **What is GitLab CI/CD, and how does it work?**
GitLab CI/CD is a continuous integration and continuous deployment tool built into GitLab. It works by defining stages and jobs in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, running pipelines to build, test, and deploy code automatically.

---

### 2. **How can you set up a GitLab runner on your machine?**
- Install the GitLab Runner using the official instructions for your platform.
- Register the runner using:
  ```bash
  gitlab-runner register
  ```
- Provide the URL and registration token from your GitLab instance.

---

### 3. **What is the purpose of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in GitLab?**
The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines the configuration for GitLab CI/CD pipelines. It specifies stages, jobs, scripts, environments, and conditions under which jobs should run.

---

### 4. **What are GitLab pipelines, and how are they structured?**
Pipelines are workflows that consist of multiple stages (e.g., build, test, deploy), each containing jobs that run sequentially or in parallel. Pipelines automate tasks like testing and deploying code.

---

### 5. **How do you secure sensitive data (like API keys) in GitLab CI/CD?**
You can secure sensitive data by storing them as **CI/CD variables** under `Settings > CI/CD > Variables` and marking them as protected or masked.

---

### 6. **Explain the difference between a public and private GitLab project.**
- **Public**: Visible to everyone, even without authentication.  
- **Private**: Only visible to authorized users with access permissions.

---

### 7. **What are GitLab variables, and how can you use them?**
GitLab variables are key-value pairs used to store and manage dynamic or sensitive information in pipelines. You can define them in the GitLab UI (`Settings > CI/CD > Variables`) or directly in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

---

### 8. **How do you trigger a pipeline manually in GitLab?**
You can trigger a pipeline manually:
1. Go to `CI/CD > Pipelines` in the GitLab project.  
2. Click **Run Pipeline** and select the branch and any necessary variables.  

---

### 9. **What is a GitLab Group, and how is it different from a Project?**
- **Group**: A container for organizing related projects and users.  
- **Project**: A single repository or codebase within a group or namespace.

---

### 10. **How do you create and protect a branch in GitLab?**
1. Create a branch using the GitLab UI or Git command.  
2. Protect the branch by going to `Settings > Repository > Protected Branches`, then specify rules (e.g., who can merge or push).

---

### 11. **How can you roll back a deployment in GitLab CI/CD?**
You can roll back a deployment by:
- Deploying a previous commit manually.
- Using a specific pipeline job designed for rollback (e.g., restoring from a backup).

---

### 12. **What are GitLab webhooks, and how do they work?**
Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that notify external services when specific events (e.g., push, merge request) occur in GitLab. You can configure them under `Settings > Webhooks`.

---

### 13. **Explain GitLab Merge Request approval rules.**
Approval rules define who must approve a merge request before it can be merged. You can set the number of required approvals and assign specific approvers under `Project > Settings > General > Merge Requests`.

---

### 14. **How can you restrict access to a specific branch in GitLab?**
Restrict access to a branch by protecting it:
- Go to `Settings > Repository > Protected Branches`.
- Set rules for who can push, merge, or delete the branch.

---

### 15. **What is the purpose of GitLab artifacts in a CI/CD pipeline?**
Artifacts are files generated by jobs in a pipeline (e.g., build outputs, test results) that can be stored and accessed later. They are defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml` using the `artifacts` keyword.

---

### 16. **How do you set up a GitLab Issue Board?**
1. Go to `Project > Issues > Board`.  
2. Customize the board by adding labels and columns to manage tasks visually.

---

### 17. **How do you use GitLab Pages to host a static website?**
1. Add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to define the static site build and deployment job.  
2. Configure the `pages` keyword in the pipeline.  
3. Commit and push your changes to trigger the pipeline and deploy the site.

---

### 18. **What is the difference between `needs` and `dependencies` in GitLab CI/CD?**
- **`needs`**: Allows jobs to run in parallel by defining dependencies explicitly.  
- **`dependencies`**: Specifies artifacts from previous jobs that a job requires.

---

### 19. **How do you set up a scheduled pipeline in GitLab?**
1. Go to `CI/CD > Schedules` in your project.  
2. Create a schedule by setting the cron-like expression, branch, and any required variables.

---

### 20. **What is the use of the `Auto DevOps` feature in GitLab?**
`Auto DevOps` automates the CI/CD process by providing pre-defined templates for building, testing, and deploying applications with minimal configuration.
